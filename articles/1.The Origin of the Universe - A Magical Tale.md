# The Origin of the Universe: A Magical Tale

## Chapter 1: The Cosmic Egg

In the beginning, there was nothing but a vast, **empty void**. Then, out of the darkness, a tiny, _glowing_ egg appeared. This was no ordinary egg; it was the **Cosmic Egg**, the source of all creation.

## Chapter 2: The Big Bang

With a sudden burst of energy, the Cosmic Egg **exploded**. This event, known as the **Big Bang**, marked the birth of the Universe. Stars, planets, and galaxies began to form from the remnants of the explosion.

```python [big_bang.py]
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simulate_big_bang(duration, points):
    """
    Simulates the Big Bang expansion over a given duration with specified points.

    Parameters:
    duration (int): The total time duration of the simulation.
    points (int): The number of points to simulate.

    Returns:
    None
    """
    time = np.linspace(0, duration, points)
    expansion = np.exp(time)

    plt.plot(time, expansion)
    plt.title('Big Bang Simulation')
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Expansion')
    plt.show()

# Simulate the Big Bang with a duration of 10 units and 100 points
simulate_big_bang(10, 100)
```


## Chapter 3: The Formation of Galaxies

As the Universe expanded, matter began to clump together, forming galaxies. These galaxies were like islands in the vast cosmic ocean.

| Galaxy Name | Distance from Earth (light-years) | Number of Stars |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Milky Way   | 0                                 | 100 billion     |
| Andromeda   | 2.537 million                     | 1 trillion      |
| Triangulum  | 3 million                         | 40 billion      |

## Chapter 4: The Mysteries of Dark Matter

Not all matter in the Universe is visible. There exists a mysterious substance known as **dark matter**. It does not emit light or energy, yet it exerts a gravitational pull on visible matter.

$$
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

Where:
- \( $F$ \) is the gravitational force
- \( $G$ \) is the gravitational constant
- \( $m_1$ \) and \( $m_2$ \) are the masses
- \( $r$ \) is the distance between the masses

## Chapter 5: The Future of the Universe

The fate of the Universe remains uncertain. Will it continue to expand forever, or will it eventually collapse back into a singularity? Only time will tell.

### Key Points

1. The Cosmic Egg is the source of all creation.
2. The Big Bang marked the birth of the Universe.
3. Galaxies formed as the Universe expanded.
4. Dark matter exerts a gravitational pull on visible matter.
5. The future of the Universe is uncertain.

### Interesting Facts

- The Milky Way galaxy contains about 100 billion stars.
- Andromeda is the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.
- Dark matter makes up about 27% of the Universe's mass-energy content.
